## How to make a RJ-45 Cable:
1. Strip the Cable to remove 1 inch of the outer sheat.
2. Untwist and straighten the wires inside of the cable.
3. Arrange the wires into the right order.

| **Pin Number**  | **Wire Color (T568B)**   | **Signal**        |
| --------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------- |
| 1               | White Orange             | Transmit + (TX+)  |
| 2               | Orange                   | Transmit - (TX-)  |
| 3               | White Green              | Receive + (RX+)   |         
| 4               | Blue                     | Unused / PoE +    |
| 5               | White Blue               | Unused / PoE +    |
| 6               | Green                    | Receive - (RX-)   |
| 7               | White Brown              | Unused / PoE -    |
| 8               | Brown                    | Unused / PoE -    |

4. Trim the wires into an even line 1/2 inch (13 mm) from sheathing.
5. Insert the wires into the RJ-45 connector.
6. Stick the connector into the crimping part of the tool and squeeze twice.
7. Remove the cable from the tool and check that all of the pins are down & test the cable.
