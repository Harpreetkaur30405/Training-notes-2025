## System Crash Analysis:

After a BSOD, Windows creates a **dump file** that records what happened before the crash.

### Tools for Analysis:
1. **event Viewer:** <br>
   Windows tool to check detailed system and crash logs.
2. **WinDbg:** <br>
   Microsoft Debugging Tool for analyzing dump files.

### BIOS/UEFI Settings and POST Errors:

| BIOS                       | UEFI                                   |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Basic Input/Output System  | Unified Extensible Firmware Interface  |
| Older firmware standard    | Modern replacement for BIOS            |
| Keyboard-only navigation   | Supports mouse and GUI                 |
| Stored in ROM chip         | stored in flash memory                 |

BIOS/UEFI is responsible for initializing hardware components before the OS loads.


**What is POST?:** <br>
POST (Power-On Self Test) is a diagnostic process that occurs when the computer is powered on. It checks for:

* RAM functionality
* CPU status
* Keyboard presence
* Display detection
* Hard disk and drives

*Common POST Errors:*

| Beep Code / Mesaage    | Meaning                                                     |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 Long, 2 Short beeps  | Graphics card issue                                         |
| Continuous Beeps       | RAM failure                                                 |
| No beep, No Display    | Power or motherboard issue                                  |
| "CMOS Checksum Error"  | Corrupted BIOS settings (usually fixed by resetting CMOS)   |

### Accessing BIOS/UEFI Settings

* Press **F2**, **F10**, **DEL**, or **ESC** continuously during startup (key depends on manufacturer).
* From here, you can:

  * Change boot order
  * Enable/Disable hardware components
  * View system info
  * Reset settings to default (if needed)

## IP Address:
An IP address (Internet Protocol address) is a unique numerical label assigned to each drive connected to a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. It acts as an identifier for the device on the network.

## Command Prompt:
*1. ipconfig:*
   ipconfig is a Command Prompt command used to display and manage the IP address and network settings of a computer in a Windows operating system.

*2. ping:*
    The ping command is used to test the connectivity between your computer and another device or server over a network.

*3. tracert:*
    The tracert (Trace Route) command is used to track the path that data takes from your computer to a destination across a network.
