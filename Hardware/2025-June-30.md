## PC Hardware Troubleshooting:
### Components of CPU:
### 1. Motherboard:
A motherboard is the main circuit board in a computer system. It connects all of the internal components, like the memory, processor, graphics card and other hadrware. Its also known as PCB (Printed circuit board).

*Some componeents of Motherboard:* <br>
- **Processor Socket:** <br>
  It is mechanical and electrical interface on a motherboard that securely connects a central processing unit (CPU) to the rest of the computer system.

- **CMOS backup battery:** <br>
  It is a small, coin-shaped battery that helps to keep the date and time accurate on computer. It ensures these settings are retained even when the computer is turned off and disconnected from a power source.

- **LAN (Local area network):** <br>
  It is the built-in Ethernet port that allows the conmputer to connect to a wired local area network for internet and data communication.

- **RAM Slots:** <br>
  Slots for installing RAM (Random Access Memory) modules.

- **Chipset:** <br>
  Communication between Northbridge (handles CPU, RAM, GPU communication) and Southbridge (handles I/O, storage decvices).

- **Expansion Slots:** <br>
  - Expansion slots on a motherboard are sockets designed to accomodate expansion cards, which add or enhance a computer's functionality.
  - Common types: PCI

- **Power Connectors:** <br>
  Connects to the power supply unit (PSU).

- **Storage Connectors:** <br>
  SATA ports for connecting hard Drives (HDD), Solid-State Drives (SSD), and Optical Drives.

- **BIOS Chip:** <br>
  Firmware that initializes hardware during startup and provides runtime services for the OS.

- **Input/Output (I/O) Ports:** <br>
  - Located on the back of the motherboard.
  - Includes USB ports, audio jacks, Ethernet, HDMI, DisplayPort, PS/2, etc.

- **Heat Sinks:** <br>
  passive cooling components for chipsets and VRMs.

### 2. **Fan:**

* Used for cooling the motherboard.
* Prevents overheating.

### 3. **Power Supply with Fan**

 * Provides **electrical power** to all parts of the computer.
 * Has a **built-in-fan** to cool itself & CPU cabinet during operation.
 * Converts electricity from the wall (AC) to usable computer power (DC).

### 4. **Connectors**

* Cables and plugs that connect components to the power supply and motherboard.

### 5. **Expansion Slots**
* Used to insert extra cards like:<br>
  * **Graphics cards**
  * **Sound cards**
  * **Wi-Fi/network cards**

### 6. **Hard Disk Drive (HDD):**
* Stores data, software, and the operating system.
* Located **under the optical drive** in the cabinet.

### 7. **Optical Drive (CD/DVD Drive):**

* Used to read/write **CDs and DVDs**

*How to locate components of a CPU?*

- Look for the power supply with fan (usually at the back top or bottom of the cabinet).
- In front of it is the optical drive.
- On it's side is the Motherboard.
- Below the optical drive is the hard disk drive. 

### Difference between RAM and cache memory:

|Feature         | **RAM (Random Access Memory)**                                      | **Cache Memory**                          |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Purpose**    | It holds programs and data that are currently executed by the CPU.  | It holds frequently used data by the CPU. |
| **Speed**      | Slower than cache                                                   | Much faster than RAM                      |
| **Size**       | Larger (in GBs, e.g., 8GB, 16GB)                                    | Smaller than RAM                          |

**Why do we need Cache memory?**
- It helps the **CPU work faster and more efficiently** by reducing the time it takes to access data.
  * Cache memory is **musch faster** than RAM.
  * It stores **frequently used instructions and data**, so the CPU doesn't have to wait for slower RAM.
  * Without cache, the Processor would **waste cycles**.<br>
So it is used to remove mismatch between RAM and Processor speed.

### Difference between RAM and Hard Disk:
| Feature                | RAM (Random Access Memory                       | Hard Disk                                     |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Purpose**            | Temporary memory for currently running programs | Permanent storage for files, software and OS  |
| **Storage type**       | Temporary (loses data when off)                 | Permanent (Keeps data when off)               |
| **Speed**              | Much faster                                     | Slower compared to RAM                        |
| **Storage Capacity**   | Smaller                                         | Larger                                        |
| **Access Method**      | Direct access by CPU                            | Slower access through file system             |
| **Cost**               | Expensive                                       | Cheaper                                       |
| **Function**           | Helps run active programs and processes         | Stores data, files, OS and installed programs |

**Process of Booting:**                            
| **Step**                                        | **Description**                                                      |
| ----------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Power On**                                 | You press the **power button**. Electricity flows to all components. |
| **2. Signal to RAM (Firmware loads bootstrap)** | The **BIOS/UEFI firmware** stored in ROM sends a signal to RAM and loads Bootstrap Loader. |
| **3. Hard Disk Copy Transferred to RAM**        | The Bootstrap Loader finds the operating system (OS) on the hard disk and copies essential OS files into RAM. |
| **4. OS Starts (OS gets control)**              | Once the OS is loaded into RAM, it takes over the system. The desktop/interface appears, and the system is ready for use.|

## Basic boot Issues:
*1. No Power*
 - Computer does not turn on at all.
 - No lights, no fan noise, screen remains black.
 - Cause: Faulty power supply, loose cables, dead battery

*2. No Display / Black Screen*
 - Computer powers on, but nothing shows on screen

*3. Beep Codes*
 - System gives beep sounds indicating hardware errors (RAM, CPU)

*4. POST Failure*
 - Power-On Self-test fails; system may freeze or beep

*5. Blue Screen of Death (BSOD)*
 - Windows crashes with a blue screen error

## Common issues and problems in PC:

### GPU (Graphics processor unit):
- Responsible for rendering graphics and visual output.
- Problems include overheating, driver issues, screen tearing, or no display output.

### PCU (Personal Computer Unit):
1. Installation and Hard Disk Preparation:<br>

* Partitioning: the first step of partitioning is to organize the hard disk into:
  * **Primary (C: Drive):** <br>
    - Where the Operating System (Windows/Linux/Unix) is installed.
    - Avoid storing personal/important files in **C:**
    - If Windows crashes, files in D:, E:, F: are safer and can often be recovered.
* **Logical Drives (D:, E:, F:):** used for pictures, videos, documents, etc.

2. Speed slow (Causes & Fixes): <br>
-       Desktop:
        Files should be on drive. By default files on desktop are stored on C drive.
        As Os system is installed in C: file, its recommend to put many folders in desktop. Move them into drives.

-       Task Bar:
        keep minimal shortcuts on the taskbar.

-       Browser (Bookmarks):
        Avoid excessive browser bookmarks as they slow down browser start-up.

-       Temporary files:
        These files are created by websites & cookies, and stored/ download in hidden files.
        Ultimately because of it the system slows down. So, after a period of time remove temporary files.

-       RAM overuse:
        Don't open a number of applications or tabs are open at once. As ultimately we are using the RAM.

-       Malware:
        Regularly scan your system for malwares.

-       Fragmentation: <br>
        There shouldn't be chaos or dely to access files. <br>
        To make system efficient in working and get work done in optimal way, defragmentation is done. <br>
        * Go to start -> Defragment and Optimize drives
        * Schedule defragmentation for automatic optimization.

3. Printer Issues & solutions:

| Problem                                 | Solution                                    |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Paper Jam                               | Remove the stuck page carefully             |
| Printer Out of Paper During Print Job   | Use Queue                                   |
| Faded or Poor Quality Prints            | Refill or replace ink/toner                 |
| Overlapping Lines in print              | Possible **drum issue**, replace the drum   |

### Blue Screen of Death (BSOD):
It is used to indicate a system crash, in which the operating system reaches a critical condition where it can no longer operate safely.

**Common Causes of BSOD:**

1. Hardware Failures: <br>
   faulty RAM<, hard disk, or other internal components
2. Driver Issues: <br>
   Outdated, incompatible, or corrupted device drivers
3. Corrupted System Files: <br>
   System file corruption due to improper shutdowns, malware, or failed updates
4. Overheating or Power issues: <br>
   Inadequate cooling or power supply malfunctions
