## Permissions & Shell programming:
### File and directory permissions:
`chmod` (Change mode): It is used to change the access permissions of files and directories.

Some differenet chmod permisssion notations are:<br>
  `chmod` +x test.sh: Gives permission to run the script.<br>
  `chmod` 444 test.sh: Changes file to read-only

![read only](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f335b301-8398-4e7b-b4b8-da9ab4fadcdb)

*Result* <br>
![read-only_result](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/42e27596-e10e-4f6a-bdb4-40513b6e9d20)


  `chmod 644 test.sh`: Changes file such that only owner can edit it. For others it remain read-only.

![user_writable](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c950b20e-34b1-48ce-8222-52ac5b304557)

*Result* <br>
![user-writable_result](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/524f435f-3f3c-43cb-9826-37d1ef8e7d95)

 `chown` (Change Owner): It is a command used to change the ownership of files or directories to a different user or group. 
 
 `To change owner`: 

![Change owner](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/939eac1d-5f2c-4601-acf9-556032d7c701)

 `To change group`:

 ![Change group](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1d35ebc8-8935-4a78-93c1-c19e023a5920)

Grep: It is a command to search for specific text or patterns within files or command output.

![grep](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b05457f5-dccc-434b-9e72-529b6c025002)

### Shell Programming:
1. Use of variables:

![variables](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ecf1bd9c-a252-4e15-b76c-69662508a78f)

*Output* <br>
![variables result](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e8115fd1-72b9-41b2-b7ef-de196ca4b048)


2. Comparing Two numbers

![Compare numbers](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/38a51327-c40e-42ae-b125-ec6a4cb0c555)

*Output* <br>
![Test result](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1b46a995-a01e-4655-b61f-0ee956de3fe3)



## Other short topics:
### Partitioning Scheme:


A **partitioning scheme**is the way a hard disk or SSD is **divided into sections** (partitions) so the system can use it properly.

**It is used for:**<br>
* Sepaerate **system files** from **user files**
* Install **multiple OSes**
* Create **swap space**
* Improve **backup & security**


### Types of Partitioning Scheme:

#### 1. MBR (Master Boot record):
- Max 4 primary partitions.
- Supports up to 2 TB.
- Older, used with BIOS.
- less flexible

#### 2. **GPT (guided Partition table)**
- Supports 128+ partitions.
- Works with disks >2 TB.
- Newer, used with UEFI.
- more flexible

### Bare Metal Installation:

* Installation directly using USB.
* Direct installation in computer hardware.
* No OS should be in between.

### Redirection:
It allows user to redirect input and output functionalities to the files or folders.

**Types of Redirection:**
1. Overwrite Redirection (For stdout):<br>
Redirects the standard output of a command to a file. If the file exists already contain script, it will be overwritten. ">" standard output


2. Append Redirection (For stdout):
Append the output to the file without compromising the existing data of the file.


3. Overwrite Redirection (For stdin):<br>
Redirects the standard input of a command to a file. "<" standard input


### Pipe '|':
The pipe is used to combine two or more commands, and in this, the output of one command acts as input to another command.
- Pipe can be used for filteration.
- Multiple pipes can be used such as:
  To find number of file/directory with 't'.

### Wild cards:

| Wildcard | Meaning                              |
| -------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `*`      | Matches **zero or more** characters  |
| `?`      | Matches **exactly one** character    |
| `[abc]`  | Matches **one character** from set   |

### File Compression:
File compression reduces file size to save space or speed up transfer.
- `gzip`:
  - Used to zip a file.
  - Limitation: The original file is deleted.
- `gunzip`:
  - Unzips the file.
-  Flag `-k`:
   - To zip the file
   - Original file isn't deleted.
