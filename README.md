### Why to use Linux over Windows?


| Reason                         | Explanation
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Cost**                       | Linux is free, while windows requires a paid license.                           |
| **Open Source**                | Linux's code is open for review, customization, and improvement.                |
| **Security**                   | Linux requires host password for every change hence it's more secure.           |
| **Customizability**            | Linux offers extensive options to customize the UI.                             |
| **Performance**                | Linux can run efficiently on older hardware.                                    |
| **Software Freedom**           | You can freely modify and redistribute Linux software.                          |
| **Stability and Reliability**  | Preferred over servers and critical systems due to strong stability.            |
| **Community Support**          | Large, active communities for help and troubleshooting.                         |
| **No Forced Updates**          | Users control when and what updates to install. It's never "take it or leave it", there's always choices. |
