## **Introduction to HTML & Web Basics**

### HTML:
* HTML stamds for HyperText Markup Language.
* It is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications.
* HTML defines the structure and content of a web page.

### **How browsers render it:**

1. The broswer reads the HTMl file line by line.
2. It builds the **DOM (Document Object Model)** - a tree-like structure of the page.
3. The browser then displays the structured content visually based on HTMl + CSS.

### Structure of an HTMl Document
* `<!DOCTYPE>` declaration defines that this document is an HTML document
* `<html>` element is the root element of an HTML page
* `<head>` element contains meta information about the HTML page
* `<title>` element specifies a title for the HTML page (which is shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab)
* `<body>` element defines the document's body, and is a conatiner for all the visible contents, such as headings, pargraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc.
* `<h1>` element defines a large heading
